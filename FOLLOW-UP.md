# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

For the front-end I've used the Tailwind library - a CSS framework that contains versatile commands for the layouts of items, their color, sizes, text properties, etc. Tailwind itself uses Craco as a dependency which it comes bundled with - Craco only has an internal role, everything else is just vanilla TypeScript and React.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

Alternatively `craco start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

Knowing the context and the intended use of the component I would realistically add some inputs that could filter through the names of the airports/dates. An appropriate addition would also be a series of dropdowns and date selectors that the used can use to customise their search experience. Further improvements would consitute changes to my code in areas where functions could become more compact and as a result more readable.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I am quite happy with the out-turn of the page in contrast to the design provided, I believe it is decently close to the original reference without having used the specific components used in the original (such as the exact font or exact colors), in some regards I would say my version is slightly more clean and minimalistic.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

The part which took the most amount of time was extracting the data needed from the JSON file provided which constituted the data for the page.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

Very fun :)
